#+TITLE: Using sem-open-preload

This is mostly meant to be used with snaps. Add the source as a part

** Using
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
parts:
  sem-open-preload:
    source: https://github.com/sergiusens/sem-open-preload.git
    plugin: make
#+END_SRC

And then add this =command-chain= to the apps entry that needs it:
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
apps:
  my-pyton-multiprocessing-app:
    command-chain:
      - sem-open-preload-launch
#+END_SRC
